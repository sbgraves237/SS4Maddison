State Space modeling using Maddison project data

Objectives: 

1. Build a state space / Kalman models for `gdppc` and `pop` for each country in the Maddison project data. 

2. Use Kalman smooth to interpolate and extrapolate (forward but not backwards) `gdppc` and `pop` for each country for all years that appear anywhere in the Maddison project data. 

3. Identify the world leader in `gdppc` for each year. 

4. Identify the world technology leader for each year by evaluating the `gdppc` leader for each year and replacing any whose leadership was narrow like members of OPEC with a country with a broad-based economy like the US. 

## Installation
